/* Total Global Wikia JS file

'''PLEASE''' note:
* Will probably not load on Wikia running versions prior to 1.10
* Should affect '''every''' skin on '''every''' page load, be very careful to not create conflicting javascript variables or functions.
* Do not edit this unless you are staff or have direct staff approval.

You can edit your personal total global js at: [[w:Special:Mypage/global.js|user/global.js]]
