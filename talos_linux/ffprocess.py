  """Runs the given process and waits for the output that matches the given

  Args:
    command: String containing command to run
    process_name: Name of the process to run, in case it has to be killed
    browser_wait: Amount of time allowed for the browser to cleanly close
    output_regex: Regular expression to check against each output line.

  Returns:
    A tuple (match, timedout) where match is the match of the regular 
    expression, and timed out is true if the process timed out and
